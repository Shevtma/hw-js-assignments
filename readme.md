## JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

|Operator|Example|Same As|
|--------|-------|-------|
|=|x = y|x = y|
|+=|x += y|x = x + y|
|-=|x -= y|x = x - y|
|*=|x *= y|x = x * y|
|/=|x /= y|x = x / y|
|%=|x %= y|x = x % y|
|**=|x **= y|x = x ** y|
|<<=|x <<= y|x = x << y|
|>>=|x >>= y|x = x >> y|
|>>>=|x >>>= y|x = x >>> y|
|&=|x &= y|x = x & y|
|^=|x ^= y|x = x ^ y|
|\|=|x \|= y|x = x \| y|

The `= assignment operator` assigns a value to a variable.

The `+= assignment operator` adds a value to a variable. It can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.

The `-= assignment operator` subtracts a value from a variable.

The `*= assignment operator` multiplies a variable.

The `/= assignment` divides a variable.

The `%= assignment operator` assigns a remainder to a variable.

The `<<= assignment operator` left shifts a variable.

The `>>= assignment operator` right shifts a variable (signed).

The `>>>= assignment operator` right shifts a variable (unsigned).

The `&= assignment operator` ANDs a variable.

The `!= assignment operator` ORs a variable.

The `**= operator` is a part of ECMAScript 2016. It does not work in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.
